tungsten has the following dependencies:

gcc (4.8) or clang (3.2)
boost (1.53)
tup (0.6-291)
gmp (5.1.0)
mpfr (3.1.1)
readline (6.2)

For the web front end
python (2.7)

Note: It is very likely that tungsten will work with newer versions of these libraries, but less likely with previous versions.
Note: It is recommended to install everything to /usr/local/ (The default install location for all of these libraries). This way tungsten should work without any extra configuration.

Installing dependencies:
--------------------

clang (http://clang.llvm.org/)
	From svn trunk: http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html
	Note: clang also has a lot of dependencies (see system requirements), but most (if not all) can be installed via apt-get.

boost (http://boost.org):
	See Getting Started section: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_53_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
	You must build the binaries as well (see section 5.1).
	Note: if you want to build the web front end as well you should first aquire python, since boost.python depends on it.

tup (http://gittup.org/tup/):
	apt-add-repository 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/anatol/tup/ubuntu lucid main'
	apt-get update
	apt-get install tup

gmp (http://gmplib.org/):
	After downloading and extracting the archive http://gmplib.org/manual/Installing-GMP.html#Installing-GMP.

mpfr (http://www.mpfr.org/):
	See INSTALL document in the downloaded archive.

readline (http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html):
	See INSTALL document in the downloaded archive.

python (http://www.python.org/):
	apt-get install python2.7-dev

Downloading tungsten:
--------------------

tungsten is hosted on Google Code, you can download it from here:
https://code.google.com/p/tungsten/source/checkout
git clone https://code.google.com/p/tungsten/

Configuring tungsten:
--------------------

There is no ./configure script for tungsten (yet).
This means, that you have to do these configurations by hand.
The configuration has to be done in the Tuprules.tup file in the root directory.
For example, if you're using clang++ for compiling (as recommended above) make sure
that $(CXX) variable has clang++ as its value.

Building tungsten:
--------------------

From the root directory of tungsten

	tup init

and then
- to build only the binary:

	tup upd bin/tungsten

- to build only unit tests:

	tup upd ut/unitest

- to build everything (including the web front end):

	tup upd
